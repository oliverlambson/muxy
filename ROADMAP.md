# Roadmap

- [ ] add benchmarks for segment trie router vs linear regex search (like Starlette)
- [ ] (maybe) add a `ctx` that the user can update in middlewares (expanding on the way `param_vars` is done)
- [ ] (maybe) add common middlewares like chi
- [ ] (maybe) add convenience constants/functions for headers and response codes
